by Allectus

Mod effects:

-AI order: Attack Turrets, Prioritizing Heavy Weapons

What the mod does:
==================

This mod adds several orders to the right click menu on the map that allow you to explicitly target subsystems on hostile capital ships.

-AI order: Attack Engines -- destroy engines
-AI order: Attack Shields -- destroy shield generators, focussing on the active shield generators that provide the most maximum shield
-AI order: Attack Turrets, Prioritizing Light Weapons -- destroy weapons, focussing on weapons with the lowest max hp (correlates with anti-fighter weapons)
-AI order: Attack Turrets, Prioritizing Heavy Weapons -- destroy weapons, focussing on weapons with the lowest max hp (correlates with anti-capital weapons)
-AI order: Attack Missile Turrets  -- destroy missile turrets

Once the subsystems covered by a given order have been destroyed the order concludes and wing may be tasked elsewhere.

Known Issues:
==================

The order icon presents as a giant questionmark. This is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functioning of the Mod.  Any advice on how to fix this issue would be appreciated.
